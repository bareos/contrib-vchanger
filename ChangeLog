vchanger ChangeLog

1.0.1  (2015-06-09)
  - When looking up the mountpoint of a magazine by UUID with libudev,
    also look for mountpoint of device alias names in DEVLINKS in addition
	to the DEVNAME.	(Fixes bug 12)
  - The f_mntonname field in struct statfs was misspelled, causing a compile
    error on BSD systems. (Fixes bug 10)
  - Use static linking of libwinpthread on Windows builds to prevent missing
    libwinpthreads-1.dll error. (Fixes bug 11)
  - Set signal handler for SIGPIPE to SIG_IGN and do not reacquire process
    lockfile when deleting the update lockfile. This should prevent a race
    condition in vchanger when Bacula invokes other instances of vchanger
    recursively when an 'update slots' or 'label barcodes' command is issued
    via bconsole. (Fixes bug 9)
  - Fixed nsis script error causing Windows installer to install incorrectly
    for 64-bit Windows and fail to create Start Menu items. Also now correctly
	removes itself from the Installed Programs list when uninstalled.
1.0.0  (2015-04-14)
  - Major change to magazine and work directory structure.
     - Virtual drive symlink points to volume file directly
     - All drive and magazine state info kept in work directory
     - Magazines have a dynamic number of virtual slots corresponding
       to a variable number of volume files
     - Volume files may be moved from one magazine to another
  - Allow an unlimited number of virtual drives
  - Add ability to issue 'update slots' and 'label barcodes' commands
    to Bacula to support plug-n-play of removable drives
  - Add support for undocumented Bacula Autochanger Interface command LISTALL
  - Added extended API command CREATEVOLS to allow creating and labelling
    volume files with a single command.
  - Added extended API command REFRESH to support plug-n-play of removable
    drives
  - Removed deprecated extended API command INITMAG
  - Add udev support for finding devices by UUID
  - Increased amount of logging
  - Enable use of getfsstat() for finding mountpoint by UUID to support
    building for BSD / OSX
  - Allow building without UUID capability to support minimal systems having
    neither libudev nor libblkid/libuuid.
  - Changed Windows version requirement to Server 2008+ / Vista+
  - Allow cross-compile of 64-bit Windows target
0.8.6  (2010-05-13)
  - Use opendir instead of stat to trigger automounts
